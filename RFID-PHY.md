- [TCOM 2010] RFID Reader Receivers for Physical Layer Collision Recovery

1. Single Antenna Zero-Forcing (SAZF) Receiver

2. Single Antenna Ordered Successive Cancellation (SAOSUC) Receiver

3. Multiple Antenna Receivers(ZF and MMSE)


- [ICT 2010] Single Antenna Physical Layer Collision Recovery Receivers for RFID Readers

Focus on the constellations in the Baseband of the Receiver and only limit the system with two collision.

s(t) = aleak + h1a1(t) + h2a2(t) + n(t)

Ultilize the channel estimation on the preamble where both tags are the same. Then a Zero-Forcing (ZF) receiver and a  Successive Interference Cancellation Receiver are implemented.

- [INFOCOM 2014]A Parallel Identification Protocol for RFID Systems

Design a novel L-K code, which encodes the tag ID into a bit string with a specially designed pattern.


# PHY 

- Physical-layer Identification of UHF RFID Tags

The author notice the BLF, which resulted in Time Interval Error(TIE), and the average baseband power (the average power of an acquired RN16 preamble) are different for different tags. Also he investigated the use of additional timing features, such as
the signal rise and fall times and the time from the reader’s transmission to the tag’s response. These timing features, however, performed poorly in both classification and identification.


# FMCW in backscatter
