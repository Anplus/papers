# Collision

- Single Antenna Physical Layer Collision Recovery Receivers for RFID Readers


# PHY 

- Physical-layer Identification of UHF RFID Tags

The author notice the unstable BLF, which resulted in Time Interval Error(TIE).


# FMCW in backscatter

- MULTICHANNEL RADAR BACKSCATTER COMMUNICATION AND LOCALIZATION

Author provided the theoretical analysis for using FMCW waveforms for communication and localization of semi-passive RF nodes intended for long-term widearea deployment.
