    >Focus on the constellations in the Baseband of the Receiver and only limit the system with two collision. s(t) = aleak + h1a1(t) + h2a2(t) + n(t). Ultilize the channel estimation on the preamble where both tags are the same. Then a Zero-Forcing (ZF) receiver and a  Successive Interference Cancellation Receiver are implemented.

    >The author notice the BLF, which resulted in Time Interval Error(TIE), and the average baseband power (the average power of an acquired RN16 preamble) are different for different tags. Also he investigated the use of additional timing features, such as the signal rise and fall times and the time from the reader’s transmission to the tag’s response. These timing features, however, performed poorly in both classification and identification.

    >A communication theoretic model for the design and analysis at the physical layer. The difference in delay, the channel fading, and the frequency of individual tags to separate the collided signals. The tags are synchronized to begin with, but differ later in the communication.
